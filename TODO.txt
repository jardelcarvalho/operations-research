Move some functions from decomposition to util (ok)
Implement graph visualization instead using images in .ipynb (this will facilitate tests at the next step)
Tests tests tests (maybe more) (ok)
Update the solver for the new mathematical model version (ok)
Extract execution time and return that with the active edges

Testing notes
The number of partitions cannot be < than the real number of components (otherwise model will be infeasible)
Update 08/10/2024: The model now will find components that maximizes the total weight
