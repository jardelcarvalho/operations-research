Move some functions from decomposition to util (ok)
Implement graph visualization instead using images in .ipynb (this will facilitate tests at the next step)
Tests tests tests (maybe more)
Update the solver for the new mathematical model version

Testing notes
The number of partitions cannot be < than the real number of components (otherwise model will be infeasible)
